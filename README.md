# LearnedIt
Your own personal digital notebook of knowledge. Learn It, Store It, Retain It.

## UX
I am using a User-Centred Design Process to ensure my application is useful, usable and provides value to both targeted users and myself (as the product owner).

I am using Jesse's design approach to go through five different planes: Strategy, Scope, Structure, Skeleton, and Surface.

### Strategy
**Goals:**

A dashboard application for learners participating in the Software Developer Learning Journey. The LearnedIt application incorporates fun, useful features that will help enrich their learning experience enabling users create unique, authentic learner journeys; so learners find their experience engaging, interacive, and most importantly memorable. 

LearnedIt is perfect for those who want to take charge of their own learning, document this throughout their career and be able to share their own accomplishments, struggles and even moments of confustion. 

**_External User Goal:_**
- Manage learning experience, learn, store and reflect upon software developer learning.

**_Site Owner's Goal:_**
- Enable users with toold to help enrich learning experience.
